                            <li class="process"> Pressure Cook The Potatoes</li>
                            <p>                                To prepare this amazing Crispy Honey Chilli Potato, wash the potatoes and keep them aside. Put a pressure cooker on medium flame and add the potatoes in them along with enough water. Also, add half a teaspoon of salt. Pressure cook them for 1 whistle and let the steam release on its own. The potatoes should be soft, but not squishy. Do not overcook the potatoes. Once the steam is released, drain the water and peel them in a large tray. Cut them nicely in a long shape, just like French fries and keep aside until required.
                            </p>
                            <li class="process"> Prepare The Cornflour Batter</li>
                            <p>                                Take a large bowl and mix together crushed garlic, red chillies, salt and cornflour. Use a little water to prepare the batter, and mix well. Keep aside for 3 to 5 minutes. Now, add the potatoes and toss well so that the mixture completely coats the potatoes.
                            </p>
                            <li class="process"> Deep Fry The Potatoes</li>
                            <p>                                Now, put a wok over medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, deep fry the potatoes till they are crispy. You can also double fry them if the required crispiness is not attained in one go.
                            </p>
                            <li class="process"> Saute The Fried Potatoes With Seasonings & Sauces</li>
                            <p>                                Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Now heat a little oil in a wok. When the oil is hot enough, add 2 chopped garlic cloves, sesame seeds, vinegar and tomato chilli sauce along with the potatoes. Cook for a minute and then turn off the heat. Pour honey, seasonings and onion shallots.
                            </p>
                            <li class="process"> Garnish And Serve</li>
                            <p>                                Toss well and sprinkle some sesame seeds and serve immediately. You can also add chopped spring onions as garnish. Make sure you try this recipe, rate it and let us know in the comments how it turned out to be.

                        <p>For the same, take a bowl and mix together sugar and water to make the sugar syrup. Then, take another bowl and mix together gram flour, turmeric powder, salt, semolina, and ginger juice. Now, pour the sugar syrup in this bowl to make the batter for the dhokla.</p>
                        <li class="process">Add Water</li>
                        <p>Half a glass of lukewarm water is added in batches to the prepared dhokla batter for a fine consistency. To bring that sourness in the dhokla, add lemon juice and mix well. Cover the bowl with a lid and keep aside this dhokla batter for around 20 minutes to rise.</p>
                        <li class="process">Prepare the tempering syrup</li>
                        <p>The syrup will make it spongy and soft. For the same, put a pan on medium flame for about 2 minutes so that it becomes hot. Once it is hot enough, heat refined oil in it. Then, add asafoetida in it along with mustard seeds, and saute for a few seconds. Quickly, add fresh chillies and curry leaves in the pan and saute till the curry leaves turn light brown in colour.</p>
                        <li class="process"> Add water to the pan along with salt and sugar</li>
                        <p>Bring it to a boil. Let the contents of the pan simmer for about 3-4 minutes to prepare the syrup. When the syrup is ready, turn off the burner and transfer to a bowl. Keep it aside.</p>
                        <li class="process">Wait is Over</li>
                        <p>By now, the batter will be ready to make besan dhoklas. Put an aluminium bowl on medium flame and use a dhokla stand. Add water in the bowl and bring it to a boil. Now, take a steel plate and grease it with oil. Then, add fruit salt into the batter, quickly add a few drops of water and whisk the batter.</p>
                        <li class="process">Pour the Batter and Cook</li>
                        <p>Now, pour the batter into the greased steel plate and put this plate inside the dhokla stand. Cover and cook the batter for about 20 minutes. Once the batter is cooked, take out the dhokla stand, and cut the dhokla into pieces and pour the prepared syrup on top of the dhokla pieces. Besan Dhokla is ready to eat, garnish with fresh coriander leave and serve quickly!</p>

            <ul class="RecipeDesc">
                <li class="process">Prepare The Chhena</li>
                <p>Making Rasgulla is a child's play if you know the right steps and almost everyone can make this delicious mithai. Take a heavy-bottomed pan and add two litres of full-cream milk to it. When it comes to a boil, reduce the flame and add the lemon juice. Your milk may take a while to curdle and you may require to add a little more lemon juice. Once the milk starts curdling, keep the flame low and allow boiling for 2-3 minutes so that the whey and chhena separates.</p>
                <li class="process">Strain the chhena from whey</li>
                <p>Switch off the gas. At this point, you can clearly see the green whey and the paneer or chhena which will separate from the water and stand out as small chunks.</p>
                <li class="process">Strain the whey</li>
                <p>Allow the hot liquid to cool for 10-15 minutes. Now take a muslin cloth or a large strainer and strain away from the whey. Wash it in running water to remove the smell of lemon. You can store this whey and use it in soups and stews or curries. It is very nutritious. Many people also like to drink it by adding a little salt or sugar.</p>
                <li class="process"> Allow the water to separate</li>
                <p>Tie it in the muslin cloth once the chenna cools a bit, squeeze away extra water and allow it to hang for some time. Do not refrigerate or it will make the chhena rubbery. This process may take 3-4 hours.</p>
                <li class="process">Prepare sugar syrup</li>
                <p>Heat water in a pan. When it comes to a boil, add sugar and allow it to simmer on low flame. After 10 minutes, check the syrup by taking a drop of the syrup in a spoon. If it is of one string consistency, your syrup is ready. Add the juice of half a lemon. This will prevent the syrup from granulating later. Also, add gulab jal and cardamom powder. Switch off the gas.</p>
                <li class="process">Knead the chhena</li>
                <p>Take the chhena from the muslin cloth and keep rubbing portions of it from your hand. At this point, you can add the maida. You have to rub it enough so that it becomes completely smooth and starts releasing a little oil. Once your chhena is smooth enough and much lighter in texture, make smooth round balls and keep aside.</p>
                <li class="process">Boil the rasgullas</li>
                <p>Meanwhile heat the sugar syrup again, till it reaches a boiling point. Make sure you make small balls as they will swell up once they absorb the syrup. Add the rasgullas one by one in the syrup ensuring there is enough space in the pan. Boil for 5-7 minutes on low flame. Do not stir.</p>
                <li class="process">Cook covered</li>
                <p>Now cover the pan and allow it to simmer on low flame for 5-7 minutes. When you remove the lid, you will be delighted to see that the rasgullas have swelled up and are looking beautiful! Switch off the flame and allow it to cool.</p>
                <li class="process">Enjoy!</li>
                <p>The rasgullas can be enjoyed warm or cold. You can also relish them topped with fruits or ice cream. Make sure you try this recipe, rate it and let us know how it turned out to be.</p>

            <li class="process">Knead a soft dough </li>
            <p>Prepare a soft dough using wheat flour and cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth to keep it soft</p>
            <li class="process">Roll a chapati and fill with the stuffing</li>
            <p>Make small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre. Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be very careful to apply pressure evenly. It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able to make perfect parathas. Seal the dough and round it with your fingers. Now, roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas. Apply the pressure very evenly and gently on all sides. Press very lightly so that the mixture does not come out.</p>
            <li class="process"> Pan fry the Aloo Paratha</li>
            <p>Heat an iron tawa and roast the parathas, cooking them on both sides with a spoonful of olive oil. If you want to use less oil on the parathas, first roast them on both sides on low flame and when they are slightly crispy, apply olive oil with a kitchen brush on both sides. You must keep the flame low.</p>
            <li class="process">Serve hot with curd, pickle and chutney</li>
            <p>Serve piping hot parathas with chilled yoghurt or pickle. You can also serve the aloo parathas with green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy. Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka paratha. You can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with this paratha.</p>
